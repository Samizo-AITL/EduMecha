**Parametric Mechanical Design Educational Materials (for Creo users)**

---

## 📘 Overview

`EduMecha` is an educational repository for systematically learning mechanical design using parametric 3D CAD (primarily PTC Creo Parametric).  
It covers a wide range of topics including 2D-to-3D conversion, visualization of design intent, enclosure design, third-angle projection, assembly modeling, and CAE integration.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✏️ 2D → 3D modeling exercises based on orthographic projection
- 📐 Understanding parametric constraints and design intent
- 🧩 Assembly modeling and part drawing practices
- 🛠 Enclosure design integrated with AITL-H intelligent control architecture
- 📊 CAE integration with tools such as Creo Simulate (stress analysis, center of gravity evaluation, etc.)
